Welcome to Sunlight's documentation!
====================================

   Sunlight is the telemetry system for Gary (our vehicle). Sunlight's purpose is to provide us with information about Gary's
   electrical system in real-time during the 2022 Formula Sun Grand Prix (FSGP) race. This information will be used to
   inform our race strategy and help us create more refined strategies for future races.
