## Rules
* Make sure to have fun!
* Commit frequently into your own branches. 
* Create a Pull Request whenever you are ready to add you working code to the `main` branch. 
* Make sure that your code passes all status checks before opening a pull request. 
* If you modify the code enough that the docs become out of date, update the docs in your pull request.
